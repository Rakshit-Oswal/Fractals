To use the files, you just need to have GLFW installed and set up on your system. The necessary glad files have been included in this repo so downloading them won't be necessary.
One of the files in the repo assumes you have GLFW installed in your system directories.
The shell file compiles, links and executes the code. For windows, you may need to write your own CMake or use WSL/Git Bash/Cygwin.

Just run the following command in the terminal:
      ./build.sh main

Maybe the build.sh file doesn't work properly, well in that case you may need to check if the linking is done properly
